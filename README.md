# rawEdgeDetection
This repository contains some source code inspired from the labs of the ELECH473 ULB course. The source code allows to perform edge detection on .raw images using digital image processing in C vs SIMD using Intel assembly. The latter option requires less clock cycles thanks to data parrallelism. 

You can build the project within CodeBlocks IDE with SIMD2.cbp file.
